# Neuroplant
Analysis code for the lab's neuroplant project.


<!---
Align images
-align phase in fourier space
-brute force with dot products of different shifts
 -use smaller regions, maybe choose regions where we know larger features will be
-do we need to deal with rotation? or just translation? hopefully no deformation
-start testing with manual alignment
background subtract
threshold
-start with Otsu's method
segment
-watershed
-reject objects that are too small

Are there other objects that also need to be removed?


Tasks:
-worm counting gui- start with imagej 
-alignment of images - after playing with images
-play with algorithm after manually aligning - Shaul
